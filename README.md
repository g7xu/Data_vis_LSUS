# dsc106_proj1
This is a Working repository for dsc 106 project 1. In this project, we were  given a [climate dataset](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc106-wi24/raw/gh-pages/resources/data/weather.csv) that contain information of the climate in major U.S. Cities.

The data contains in total 7 columns:
- **`city`**: The name of the city.
- **`lon`**: The longitude of the city.
- **`lat`**: The latitude of the city.
- **`month`**: The name of a month (Jan, Feb, etc.).
- **`monthnum`**: The number of a month (1, 2, etc.).
- **`sunshine`**: The average hours of sunshine observed during that month.
- **`rain`**: The average inches of rain observed during that month.

This project will provide a expository visualization to communicate the an idea from the data set. Following by an visualization, an rigorous rationale of the design will be discussed.


# Key finding from exploratory data analysis
---
- Miami city has the less flucuation of the sunshine acorss year
- Chicago city has the most flucuation of the sunshine amount across year
- all the avaliable city is located near the oceanside
- left of US tend to have less rainfall, and right of US tend to have more rainfall
- the rain fall season in San Diego and San Francisco is at the beginning and the end of the year, whiles other 4 citities are exactally opposite






# Brainstorm Ideas
- identifying which city is most similar to the other?
    - purpose: informing people which city they can move to 
- identifying which city is most favouriable to travel?
- 



<!-- - creating visualization that help people knowing the best time to visit each city
    - visualizing the change in sunshine and rain acorss month in each big locations
- the impact of lontitude and latitude on sunshines each month
    - prove to technious there is correlation bewteen coordinates and sunshine and rainfall
- all of the city is located on the edge of the US map and they are near the ocean
    - city located near the ocean usually follow a similar trend on sunshine and rain fall
- which city are most similar to another
    - 




- reveal the underline trend or pattern between sunshine and rainfall
- the best city to have vaction in a specifc time of the year
    - reveal the extreme whether condition
- how geography information correlation with the sunshine and rain -->


TODO:
- rainfall comparsion based on latitude 
- rainfall comparsion based on lontitude
